# BigMart-Sales-prediction
This project is the prediction model for the sale prices of the products sold at BIg Mart shopping.

The dataset includes different items, with different prices sold at different stores. 
The data scientist performed data preprocessing techniques and predictive modelling techniques to come up with the final predictive model. 


Sales forecasting is a critical business exercise. Accurate sales forecasts allow business leaders to make smarter decisions on various  business operations like, budgeting, hiring, setting business goals among other factors affecting cash flow. Inaccurate sales forecast leaves sales managers guessing at whether theyâ€™ll actually hit quota. As a result, they may not be aware of any problems in the sales pipeline in time to fix them.

As a data scientist, I used open source Walmart dataset to help get a clear picture of the sales per week. The data was generated for a long period of time, and proper analysis could help to ganner the right insights and helps you take the necessary steps towards continuous growth.
A prediction model was achieved at the end of the project.

Feture developments could be deploying the model into production and being able to make the sales forecasts in real time.
